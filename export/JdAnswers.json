    "userAnswer": "The difference between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is mainly about scope and methods:\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI):\n\nA broad field of computer science focused on building systems that can simulate human intelligence‚Äîsuch as reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding natural language.\n\nIncludes many approaches: rule-based systems, expert systems, planning, robotics, computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning.\n\nGoal: Create machines that can ‚Äúthink‚Äù and act intelligently.\n\nMachine Learning (ML):\n\nA subset of AI that focuses on systems that can learn from data and improve performance over time without being explicitly programmed.\n\nUses algorithms and statistical models to find patterns in data and make predictions or decisions.\n\nExamples: spam email filtering, recommendation systems, fraud detection.\n\nGoal: Learn from experience (data) to perform tasks better.\n\nüëâ In short:\n\nAI = big concept (machines acting smart).\n\nML = one way to achieve AI (by letting machines learn from data).\n\nWould you like me to also give a simple analogy (like human intelligence vs. learning from experience) so it‚Äôs easier to explain quickly in an interview or presentation?",
    "feedback": "This answer provides a thorough and accurate distinction between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The explanation covers both definitions, their scopes, methods, and goals, making the core difference clear. The use of examples (spam filtering, recommendation systems) helps contextualize ML, while mentioning AI approaches (rule-based systems, expert systems, etc.) demonstrates a good grasp of the breadth of AI. The short summary and offer of an analogy show strong communication skills and awareness of interview dynamics. However, the answer could be slightly more concise for a junior interview, and the technical terms could be simplified further. The content is very relevant and well-structured, but a simpler analogy or direct comparison (e.g., 'All ML is AI, but not all AI is ML') would enhance clarity for beginners.",
